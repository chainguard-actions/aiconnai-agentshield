# Code Review Policy - AgentShield Harness

This policy is authoritative for `review-gate.sh` prompts and human review of AgentShield scanner and harness changes.

## Required Verdict Format

Every generated review artifact must contain exactly one final verdict marker:

```text
REVIEW_VERDICT: PASS
```

or:

```text
REVIEW_VERDICT: FAIL
```

The verdict must be followed by findings prefixed with `[BLOCKER]`, `[HIGH]`, `[MED]`, or `[LOW]` when findings exist.

## Severity Taxonomy

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[BLOCKER]` | Unsafe to merge; likely security regression, scanner false negative, broken output contract, broken gate, or hidden scope creep |
| `[HIGH]` | Material risk; likely false positive/negative drift, CLI/action/release/VS Code breakage, missing complex-change evidence, or gate weakening |
| `[MED]` | Correctness, maintainability, docs parity, or test coverage risk that should be fixed or explicitly accepted |
| `[LOW]` | Minor clarity, naming, ergonomics, or follow-up item |

## Review Focus

Reviewers must inspect for:

- scanner false negatives or false positives;
- adapter-to-IR contract violations;
- taint, sanitizer, cross-file analysis, source/sink, or policy mistakes;
- SARIF 2.1.0 and GitHub Code Scanning compatibility drift;
- JSON output drift that could break the VS Code extension;
- CLI, baseline, suppression, certify, egress, or wrap behavior drift;
- GitHub Action exit-code and SARIF upload behavior drift;
- release binaries accidentally omitting expected `full` features;
- offline-first or privacy regressions;
- documentation claiming more than code or gates prove;
- hidden scope creep against `docs/harness/WHAT_WE_DONT_DO.md`.

## Fake-Success Patterns

Flag these as `[HIGH]` or `[BLOCKER]` depending on impact:

- tests or sensors that only prove a command ran, not that expected behavior occurred;
- SARIF shape checks that do not inspect required top-level fields;
- fixture scans that ignore scanner error exit codes;
- baseline or suppression changes that hide new findings silently;
- review artifacts without `REVIEW_VERDICT` markers;
- skipped checks omitted from progress or verification evidence;
- harness script changes reviewed only by the changed harness script.

## Review Canvas Requirement

If the diff is complex, verify that a matching Review Canvas exists under `docs/harness/canvas/` and contains:

- approaches considered and rejection reasons;
- hot-path complexity notes;
- at least two edge cases to test or trace;
- a breakage-risk table with mitigation and rollback.

Complex triggers are defined in `docs/harness/GATES.md` and `docs/harness/canvas/README.md`.

## Harness Script Changes

Harness script changes are process-critical. Reviewers must inspect them directly and must not rely only on generated prompt summaries.

Changes to `docs/harness/bin/*` require independent post-review evidence. If independent evidence is missing, `review-gate.sh post` must fail before claiming review success.
